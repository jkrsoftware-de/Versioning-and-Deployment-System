## ðŸ’¬ Informations about the â€žVersioning and Deployment-Systemâ€œ

"*Jerry, what is the â€žVersioning- and Deployment-Systemâ€œ?* someone â€” may â€” would ask me.

The Versioning- and Deployment-System is a Bundle of Bash-Scripts, helping me to introduce a simple Approach of Versioning and Deployment to
my Projects via GitLab-CI.

I have a lots of Projects, where I need such an Use-Case of version & deploy Software-Projects. It's easy to expandable / adjustable for me.

Currently it's not optimized for public Usage.<br />
That doesn't mean, you can't use it right away â€” but this Bundle isn't optimized as a Public-Release yet.

You can ask me, if you need help. ðŸ˜Š<br />
You'll find my Contact-Informations here: [contact-informations.md](contact-informations.md).

## ðŸ“• About all of my public-accessible (Open-Source) Software-Products.

Read the following Paragraphs, if you want. ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸ“ƒ I use the â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ- / â€žHexagonalâ€œ-Software-Design.

For every newly-created Software, I use the **â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ-Design**.

For better understanding â€” what the **â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ-Design** is â€” have a look
here: [Wikipedia (EN) Â· Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))

### ðŸ“ƒ The underlying Software-License.

This Software is free forever.

There is nothing to pay and nothing to fulfill, to use/to edit/to (re-)publish my written Software-Code.

*You can also have a look at: [license.md](license.md) in the same Directory.*

### ðŸ“ƒ Lifetime-Maintain-Promise.

**I promise, to keep every Software-Project maintained in my Lifetime.**<br />
Every Software-Project, I release, will always be maintained, unless I'll communicate something else.

Currently, each Software-Project is also used by myself.<br />
So I create/maintain the Software for me and for you. ðŸ˜Š
