Just read the following Paragraphs. ðŸ˜Š

### ðŸ“ƒ I use the â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ- / â€žHexagonalâ€œ-Software-Design.
For every newly-created Software, I use the **â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ-Design**.

For better understanding â€” what the **â€žPorts & Adaptersâ€œ-Design** is â€” have a look here: [Wikipedia (EN) Â· Hexagonal Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software))

## ðŸ’¬ Informations about the â€žVersioning and Deployment-Systemâ€œ

"*Jerry, what is the â€žVersioning- and Deployment-Systemâ€œ?* someone â€” may â€” would ask me.

The Versioning- and Deployment-System is a Bundle of Bash-Scripts, helping me to introduce a simple Approach of
Versioning and Deployment to my Projects via GitLab-CI.

I have a lots of Projects, where I need such an Use-Case of version & deploy Software-Projects.
It's easy to expandable / adjustable for me.

Currently it's not optimized for public Usage.<br />
That doesn't mean, you can't use it right away â€” but this Bundle isn't optimized as a Public-Release yet.

You can ask me, if you need help. ðŸ˜Š<br />
